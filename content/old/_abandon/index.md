I recently discussed with some collegues ideas around quit. That discussion was going around the job, but this thought has been accompaining me for my whole life: I also thought to quit hobbies, relations, friendships, and so on. It is not just an ipotetical thought: in general my thinking is quite concrete. I reflect on the practical steps to take, the benefits, and the sensation along and after the process. From a practical level, quitting is always an option, while maybe it is not on a moral, psycological, and more realistic one. Hence, the thought of a different path is, somehow, relieving, maybe just because we know it is a dream that cannot be realized.

In a society where everything revolute around the idea of being successful, smiling, and realized, sharing negative thoughts may be percived as something to isolate, to stigmatize, and could demotivate people. However, I believe that a fundamental role of everyone (and it is central in the educational system), is conveying our own life experience transparently. We are free to strategize and adapt our communication, but without an honest thought it is just fantasy narrative. I would also say that I don't support the romanticism of bad experiences either. The narration around "fails are good" does not sound rational to me. Negative experiences are indeed part of the life, they defently teach us something (hopefully), but also we don't like it and we would have a better life experience if we only could suceed without bad things. For these reasons, talk about quitting to me need to come toward a concrete perspective. Thought about dropping exist, and affect us concrently. They are normal, but they are not positive and highlight problems; they can teach us something, but they require actions. I hence decided to be concrete in my text, and leave interpretations to individual sensitivity. 

My feeling around quitting often comes after a failure that pass through people.
