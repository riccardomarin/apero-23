Looking back, I see two things I have almost always enjoyed: computers and writing. I have done both for a long time, with some rare attempts to do both together.

In the last six years, I have focused on scientific research. With time passing, I feel that a significant part of my work schedule is shifting toward communication. And I have felt an increasing need to share thoughts somewhere.

I believe that one of the main reasons is the time I spent writing projects to get funds. In the last two years, I had many occasions to discuss how to disseminate my research, inform and communicate, and I also think that science communication is becoming more and more part of pop culture, and we are all more used to digesting even complex topics.

The following month I will start a new cycle in my research career, and I desire that writing and communication be a part of this. Hence, while redoing my website, I decided also to have a space to let me do that.

One thing that I have found challenging to start something like a blog is the idea of "publishing" only finished products. I discovered that this terrifies me: polished contents require time, and the requirement that they have a definitive form also requires compromising with the satisfaction of the results. While preparing this website, I discovered the concept of *Digital Garden*[1], a space freely organized where content might grow over time and in different ways (escaping the tombstone of the chronological order). I find this concept relaxing, and it fits my needs. This will let me the chance to post things once they pop into my mind and refine them in a second moment.

This space will be dedicated to science and communicate the progress of my research and, in part, share other ideas and opinions more randomly. I believe this will contribute to personal relaxation, a valid dissemination process, and hopefully some beauty.
