It must be the summer of 2011 or so. I am in front of high-school commission, and I have just taken my oral exam. At that time (I don't know if it still works like this) the examination was carried by external and internal referees. Before letting me go, they ask the ritual question: "What will you do next?". I remember that was a huge question for my entire last year. 

I had been terrified by the end of the high-school, as a place where I had maximum freedom, and also enstablished good relations (some of them are still quite alive right now). For some time I thought that the life was almost over: what would come next, would be a life of burden, work, and in completly new environments maybe far from home. The major of that school was Accountancy, and I did that because I expected to interrupt my studies after it. But during the last year I started to get more information, and to understand that many things were still possible. I do not remember exactly what has been the main motivation (it might be written somewhere, in a personal journal that I kept for some years -- but that I lost six or fives years ago), but in the end I had decided to proceed with my studies. 

Well, to come back to the question from the committee, I had a quite precise answer: "Let's say that for the 60% I will enroll for Computer Science Bachelor. 30% I would go with psicology. The last 10% is to take one year in the army, because I would work in the IT department of police (sort of online fraud squad)". The whole the committee invited me to take the Computer Science path, which was also the most natural. 

After more than ten years, now I am a Researcher in Computer Science. During the whole path, I tried to do not forget my passion about psicology. And honestly, it wasn't that difficult since for the whole time I've encountered any sort of psicological distress. From the personal sphere to the professional one -- in myself and in people around me. 

I guess it is part of the human experience, regardless the path that one follows. We face 



The critcial aspect is that at a given point the stress might become unsustainable[1].
