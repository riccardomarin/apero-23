intro: I am from Verona -- Yawp, you may have heard of that for Romeo and Juliet. I am passionate about creative writing, and when I was young, I kept a blog for over ten years. I am passionate about theatre; I have been an amateur actor, a director assistant, a co-organizer of festivals, and an excited spectator. I like to spend my free time cooking, reading (especially graphic novels), playing board games, or learning something new (at the moment is digital painting).
