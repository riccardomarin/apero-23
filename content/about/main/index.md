intro: I am from Verona -- Yawp, you may have heard of that for Romeo and Juliet. I am passionate about creative writing, and when I was young I kept a blog for more then 10 years. I am passionate of theatre, I have been an amatuer actor, a director assistant, a co-organizer of festivals, and a viewer. I like to spend my freetime in cooking, reading (especially graphic novels), boardgames, or learning something new (which at the moment is digital painting).
