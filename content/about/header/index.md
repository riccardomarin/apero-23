**BIO**
<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Post Doctoral researcher, awarded with a Humboldt Post-Doctoral Fellowship and a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Post-Doctoral Fellowship, at the University of Tuebingen in the Real-Virtual Humans group led by Gerard Pons-Moll. 

Previously, I was a post-doc at Sapienza University of Rome in the GLADIA group led by Emanuele Rodol√†, leading a work package of the SPECGEO ERC project. I followed the University of Verona's Ph.D program in Computer Science, under the supervision of Umberto Castellani, collecting a Best PhD Thesis award by EG-Italy. 

I work on Spectral Shape Analysis, Shape Matching Geometric Deep Learning, and Virtual Humans. My work appears in top level conferences and journals (NeurIPS, IJCV, CGF, 3DV), obtaining also a Best Student Paper Award (3DV 2020).  I am a member of the ELLIS Society, and I served as conference organizer (RCD Committee at SIGGRAPH, Volunteer Chair at 3DV 2018 and STAG 2021), as reviewer for several journals and conferences (PAMI, TCVG, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR), obtaining five Outstanding Reviewer Awards.
