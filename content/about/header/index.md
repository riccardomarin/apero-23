**BIO**
<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Computer Vision Group of the Technical University of Munich (TUM), supervised by Prof. Daniel Cremers. Previously, I was a postdoc funded by a Humboldt and a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Post-Doctoral Fellowships at the University of Tubingen in the Real-Virtual Humans group led by Prof. Gerard Pons-Moll, and a post-doc at Sapienza University of Rome in the GLADIA group led by Prof. Emanuele Rodol√†.

I followed the University of Verona's Ph.D program in Computer Science, under the supervision of Prof. Umberto Castellani, collecting a Best PhD Thesis award by EG-Italy. I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Verona (2017). I work on Spectral Shape Analysis, Shape Matching Geometric Deep Learning, and Virtual Humans. 

My work appeared in top-level conferences and journals (NeurIPS, IJCV, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, CGF) and collected prestigious awards (Best Student Paper 3DV20, Top Cited CGF 2020-21, Best paper at NeurReps Workshop).  

I served as conference organizer (RCD Committee at SIGGRAPH, Volunteer Chair at 3DV18 and STAG21), as Associate Editor (AI Communications Journal), as a reviewer for several journals and conferences (PAMI, TCVG, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML), obtaining six Outstanding Reviewer Awards.  I am a member of the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS), and I got Italian professorships habilitation (ASN) for Computer Science (01/B1) and Information Engineering (09/H1).
